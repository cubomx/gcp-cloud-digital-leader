**Continuous learning**: iterative & continous lauch
Try, learn from the output, and then try again.
When you have the answers, start experimenting and building.
Seek feedback quickly, and you might fail the first time, but if you do fail fast, instead of wasting your time, perfecting your idea.
The more ideas you try, the more you learn, and the more you'll eventually succeed.
